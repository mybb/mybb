## Free never tasted so good.
MyBB is a free and open source, community-based, forum software project. Learn more at [MyBB.com](http://www.mybb.com).

### MyBB 1.6

The master branch contains the source code for MyBB 1.6. It contains the latest bug fixes for the 1.6 series and while you're free to use the code on your own forum to fix specific issues, support may not be provided on MyBB.com until it makes a release.

### MyBB 1.8

The feature branch contains the source code for MyBB 1.8. It contains a lot of development code, and is currently considered unstable. It is NOT recommended that you use MyBB 1.8 as a live forum but we encourage you to get involved with testing and contributing to help ease the development. MyBB 1.8 is not supported and won't be until it's stable.
