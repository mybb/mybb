# Contributing to MyBB

To **report a confirmed bug or problem**, create a thread the Community Forums for the appropriate version of MyBB within the [Development category](http://community.mybb.com/forum-161.html), if the problem was not reported already on the Forums or as [Issues](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues) on GitHub. If it is, but receives little attention, you can share details on how it impacts your forum to help diagnose the problem.

To **suggest changes or features**, go to the [**Suggestions and Feedback**](https://community.mybb.com/forum-199.html) forum. Please make sure that your feature hasn't already been suggested and is not already planned.

Help prioritize [Issues](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues) by adding a "üëç" reaction to new features you'd like to see in MyBB or for problems affecting you.

## MyBB on GitHub

### Branches

#### Maintenance/Legacy Branches
- `master` Currently contains legacy code of MyBB 1.6.

- `feature` Currently contains code for MyBB 1.8.

#### Workflow for MyBB 1.9 and up
- `master`

  After the MyBB 1.9 release, `master` will contain code of latest stable release for latest stable branch, or `master/*` for given older branch (e.g. _master/1.9_ for 1.9).

  -  `hotfix/*` (e.g. _hotfix/1.10_) Quick releases for critical issues. When ready, the hotfix branch is merged back to _master/*_ and _develop/*_ (or _release/*_, if one exists).


- `develop/*` Contains current development version with changes that were applied after the last release.

    - `release/*` (e.g. _release/3.2.1_) Release preparation - version numbers and other metadata.

      Immediately preceding the actual release, security patches are merged in and the release branch is merged back into _develop/*_ and _master/*_.

    - `feature/*` (e.g. *feature/custom-avatars*) New features being worked on. When completed and tested, the feature branch is merged back to _develop/*_.

### Issues
Bugs and improvements to MyBB software packages are documented in corresponding _Issues_.

Issue titles should work as short summaries identifying the problem or intent:

Type | Title Style | Title Examples
-|-|-
Bugs and problems | Problem declaration (declarative mood) | - _Moderator notes fail to get saved_ <br>- _Moved thread link name not changing properly_
Improvements and tasks | Instruction (imperative mood) | - _Move Who's Online building into a function_ <br>- _Omit unwanted links / buttons_
Features | Feature name | - _Goodbye Spammer Integration_ <br>- _Global 2FA_

#### Labels
Triaged Issues usually have multiple [**Labels**](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/labels) assigned:
- Branch (`b:*`), the x.**Y** release branches they are related to,
- Priority (`p:*`), how important they are (1 per Issue),
- Status (`s:*`), what stage the development is currently in (1 per Issue),
- Type (`t:*`), what kind of problem or operation they are related to.
- Involving (`i:*`), additional labels for specific modules, libraries, or types.
- `3rdparty`, assigned to external code and other third-party solutions,
- [`easy-pick`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/labels/easy-pick), used for simple issues for new contributors that don't require extensive MyBB knowledge to resolve.

Labels are generally only used for Issues.

#### Milestones
Issues can have specific [**Milestones**](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/milestones) assigned, meaning that they are expected to be addressed in given versions.

#### Assignments
Issues with personal assignments are expected to be handled by assigned developers. Similarly, the review process of Pull Requests can be directed by developers assigned to them.

### Commits
Follow [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules).

### Pull Requests
Pull Requests (PRs) should only be sent for [confirmed Issues](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3As%3Aconfirmed), and only one issue should be fixed per Pull Request.

All changes made in Pull Requests must follow the development standards:
- for MyBB 1.8, see [MyBB Documentation &rsaquo; Development Standards](https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/development/standards/),
- for MyBB 1.9 and later, follow the [PSR-2 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

Use imperative mood in the title and reference the Issue ID in the message. If possible, use the `Resolve #ID Issue title` format (e.g. _Resolve #123 Wrong error message_).

Include a [closing keyword](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) for each resolved Issue at the beginning of the Pull Request's description, e.g.
```
Resolves #123
Resolves #345

Replaces Anvil::push() with Anvil::fall().
```
